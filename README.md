# Version Control for jQuery
Version Control for jQuery is the easiest way to control the version of jQuery used on your website. Whether you just want to run a stable Wordpress website, or if you are a developer and want to cross check your website with the various version of jQuery, the plugin will always have the latest minified version of jQuery ready for you, loaded from the super-fast jQuery CDN. The default settings of this plugin are always the latest stable jQuery release.
